					<h2>Lightweight</h2>
					<p>
						Sometimes referred to as ultraportable or ultrathin, the lightweight laptop
						 is twice the size of a netbook, yet it still feels light and easy to carry.
						  This category offers a perfect balance of performance and portability, especially 
						  for frequent flyers. These models are plenty fast for most types of work and have a
						   mid-size screen that's comfortable to work on. Most even have built-in DVD burners,
						 which netbooks do not. This category can be expensive if you order the biggest hard drive 
						 or fastest processor available.
					</p>
					<p>
						Key Characteristics:
						13.3 to 14-inch diagonal screen
						Less than 4lbs (Ours start at 3.2 lbs)*
						Processor types: dual to quad-core*
						Up to 6GB DDR3 system memory
						Shared video memory
						Choice of 250GB or bigger hard drive; some even
						come with a 128GB solid-state drive
						Built-in optical drive .

					<h2>Everyday Computing</h2>
					<p>
						Also called a midsize or mainstream notebook, this category falls into the broad middle in terms of weight,
						 screen size, technology, and price. A few models have top-shelf features such as a 17.3-inch diagonal
						  widescreen or powerful processor. The everyday laptop has enough 
						muscle to do almost any task, but it’s too heavy and too short on battery life to make a great travel laptop.	
					</p>
					<p>
Key Characteristics:
15.6-inch, all the way to 18.4-inch diagonal screen
Starting at 5 lbs*
Intel® or AMD Dual-Core™ processors
2GB to 6GB DDR3 system memory*
Shared or dedicated video memory
Up to 1TB hard drive*
Built-in DVD burner.

					<h2>Desktop Replacement</h2>
					<p>
						This portable delivers a full PC experience. It offers a comfortable keyboard, 
						large hard drive, a huge screen and great system memory. The stereo speakers are loud and rich,
						 plus you’ll find exciting emerging mobile technology such as Intel Wireless Display, which lets
						  you play your laptop’s picture on your big-screen HDTV without wires.
						 With all these features, a desktop replacement is too large for comfortable travel, and battery life is very short
					</p>
					<p>

Intel® or AMD dual- to quad-core processor
4GB to 8GB DDR3 system memory

					<h2>Built for Business</h2>
					<p>
						Though this category of laptop doesn’t need to handle the demands of gaming 
						or HD movies, it does need a processor that can juggle all the apps of an office suite.
						 It also should have long battery life to hold its charge during extended stretches on the road.
						  Wi-Fi (802.11n) is, of course, essential, but you should also consider wireless WAN so you can 
						stay connected away from hot spots. Robust security features to safeguard sensitive data are also must.
					</p>

13.3 to 17.3-inch diagonal screen
3GB RAM or more
Intel™ or AMD dual- to quad-core processor
